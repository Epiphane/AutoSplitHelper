# AutoSplitHelper

This mod adds extra event logging to Satisfactory's main output, which can be used by autosplitters to trigger clock events. The extra log options are all findable by searching for "LogAutoSplitHelper" in your game logs, and will report:

- Intro is over (start the timer)
- HUB Upgrade purchases
- Space elevator submissions
- Game session exits (reset/pause)

I'm a human, with a human life and human needs. I'l happily respond to issues and review pull requests when I can, but I have other things to do than mod Satisfactory. Please be patient with me or reach out via Discord (Epiphane#6997, or the server linked above) if you have concerns, feedback, or questions :)
